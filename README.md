# CTS URN subnamespace registry


## Overview


CTS URNs require a subnamespace that can be resolved to a URI.   The registry of CTS URN subnamespaces is maintained at the institutional repository of the College of the Holy Cross at <http://crossworks.holycross.edu/cts-subnamespaces>.

The raw data for the published registry are managed in this repository as a CITE2 Collection.  The file `schema.cex` defines the structure of the collection.  Data in CEX format are in `subnamespaces.cex`.


## Submission process

To propose a new CTS URN subnamepace, add a row for the proposed record to `subnamespaces.cex` and submit a pull request.  The email address identified as the contact  will be automatically notified of the result when the proposal has been processed.
