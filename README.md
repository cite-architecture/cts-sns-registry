# CTS URN subnamespace registry


## Overview


CTS URNs require a subnamespace that can be resolved to a URI.   The registry of CTS URN subnamespaces is maintained at the institutional repository of the College of the Holy Cross at <http://crossworks.holycross.edu/cts-subnamespaces>.

The raw data for the published registry are managed in this repository as a CITE2 Collection.  The file `schema.cex` defines the structure of the collection.  Data in CEX format are in `subnamespaces.cex`.
